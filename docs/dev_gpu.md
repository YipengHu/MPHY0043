# GPU Computing

Most tutorials and coursework run with CPU and may need machine-specific configuration in order to run on GPU(s).

- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) provides freely available computing resource, though restrictions apply.
- UCL Department of Computer Science hosts a [high performance computing cluster](https://hpc.cs.ucl.ac.uk/), with independent technical support.

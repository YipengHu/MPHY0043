# Point Set Classification

This tutorial is adapted from [Point cloud classification with PointNet](https://keras.io/examples/vision/pointnet/) with TensorFlow and Keras.

Here, we use intra-operative motion data from an ultrasound-guided prostate intervention, for a motion detection problem. The clinical background can be found in the [MPHY0030 SSM tutorial](https://weisslab.cs.ucl.ac.uk/YipengHu/mphy0030/-/tree/main/tutorials/statistical_motion_model/python).

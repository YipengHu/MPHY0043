## 1. Programming and development

### Python, numerical computing 
All practical tutorials, group work and coursework projects in this module are based on Python, with a number of common libraries, including NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib. For a refresher or relevant materials in medical image analysis, please have a look at the [UCL Module MPHY0030 - Programming Foundations in Medical Image Analysis](https://weisslab.cs.ucl.ac.uk/YipengHu/mphy0030).

### Machine learning, deep learning
This module uses two deep learning libraries, [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

Guide and tutorial materials for the deep learning libraries can be found at the [UCL Module COMP0090 - Introduction to Deep Learning](https://github.com/YipengHu/COMP0090), with a more medical-relevant materials in the [UCL Module MPHY0041 - Machine Learning in Medical Imaging](https://weisslab.cs.ucl.ac.uk/YipengHu/mphy0041).

### Other development tools
[Git](https://git-scm.com/).

[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
